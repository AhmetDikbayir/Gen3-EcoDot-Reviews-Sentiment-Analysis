# Gen3-EcoDot-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
I used Amazon Gen 3 Ecodot product reviews dataset which I downloaded on the Kaggle. The dataset has 4084 rows and 4 columns. I used reviews and divison column in this analysis. I used Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine(2 different model). I visualize data with WordCloud. I used NLTK libraries for StopWords and SnowBallStemmer for determining the root of the words. For evaluating the models, I calculate Accuracy score, Confusion Matrix adn Classification Report.
